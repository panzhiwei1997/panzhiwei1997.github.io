I'm a sixth-year postgraduate student from [The Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Linhua Jiang](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~jiang/index.html) of KIAA, PKU. My research interest includes the Active galactic nucleus (AGNs), high-redshift quasars, coevolution between supermassive black hole and its host galaxy, statistical analysis, and so on.
