Spatial density evolution of quasars
=====
My research initiative is focused on studying the properties of quasars, in particular the changes in their spatial density over time. The Quasar Luminosity Function (QLF) and the Black Hole Mass Function (BHMF) serve as key mathematical frameworks that illustrate the variation in the spatial distribution of quasars as a function of their luminosity, black hole mass, and redshift. We have completed a significant study of the QLF in the redshift range 3.5 to 5.0, as detailed in our recent publication ([Pan et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..172P/abstract)). Our quasar sample bridges previous QLF studies from brighter and deeper surveys, as shown in the figure below. Our results indicate that the cumulative density evolution of quasars from redshifts around 5 to 3.5 is well captured by a pure density evolution model, implying a nearly uniform evolution iof the quasar density at z = 3.5 - 7.

We extend our analysis to include the DESI quasar sample at 1.5<z<3.5, and combine the results from both datasets for a broader survey spanning z = 1.5 to 5. (Yin et al. to be submitted.) We aim to increase the redshift resolution of the QLF, derive more accurate redshift of the quasar density peak, and characterize the evolution of the quasar population over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities with small systematic uncertainties. I also contribute to the simulation of the evolutionary pathways for a large sample of BHs growing from their initial seeding at z ≳ 20 to z ≃ 4, using the observed QLF data ([Li et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969...69L/abstract)).
